## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Outlier Handling**: IQR-based capping at the 99th percentile to reduce noise.
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalized data using `MinMaxScaler` (range: 0–1).
- **Sequence Creation**: Time-series sequences of 60 days for LSTM input.

### 2. Model Architecture
- **Layers**:
    - 2 LSTM layers (50 units each) with dropout (20%) to prevent overfitting.
    - Dense output layer for regression.
- **Training**:
    - Optimizer: Adam.
    - Loss: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
    - Epochs: 10, Batch Size: 32.

### 3. Evaluation Metrics
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error.
- **Accuracy**: Derived as `1 - RMSE` (scaled to percentage).

## Results

### Key Findings
- **Closing Price Trends**: Visualized historical prices showing volatility and long-term trends.
- **Correlation Matrix**: Strong correlation between Open, High, Low, and Close prices (~99%).
- **Model Performance**: Achieved **97.51% accuracy** on test data with minimal RMSE.

### Visualizations
- **Price Over Time**: Line plot of closing prices (2000–2024).
- **Volume Trends**: Volume fluctuations aligned with price movements.
- **Outlier Analysis**: Boxplots before/after preprocessing.

## Conclusion
The LSTM model effectively captures temporal patterns in stock data, providing reliable predictions. Future work could incorporate external factors (e.g., news sentiment) or hyperparameter tuning for further optimization.
